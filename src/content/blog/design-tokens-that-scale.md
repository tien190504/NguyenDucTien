A small set of tokens can make a multi-page site feel consistent even as content grows.

## Core tokens

- Type scale: two headline sizes, one body size.
- Color: one accent, two neutrals, subtle surface tint.
- Spacing: 4, 8, 12, 20, 32.

## Why it matters

Consistency reduces design debt and makes future updates faster.

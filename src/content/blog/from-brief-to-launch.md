I keep my projects small, clear, and shippable. The key is to split the work into tiny slices that can be tested and deployed quickly.

## What works for me

- Define outcomes, not tasks.
- Build a thin vertical slice first.
- Keep design tokens and components consistent.

## Next steps

If you are building your own portfolio, start with a clear navigation and a focused set of projects. The rest can grow later.
